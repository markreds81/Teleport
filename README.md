Teleport modem 2 wi-fi conversion firmware.

## Introduction
This is the firmware used for my [Teleport Gold Modem Reconversion](https://www.markreds.it/2020/09/26/teleport-gold-modem-reconversion/).
It started as a fork from [bozimmerman/Zimodem](https://github.com/bozimmerman/Zimodem) project version 3.6.5 but after a while I decided to restart from scratch with a new design and with the goal to keep the code more compact and best optmized for the ESP32 module.
